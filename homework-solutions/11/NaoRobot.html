			<h2>Development History</h2>
			<p>
				Nao (pronounced now) is an autonomous, programmable humanoid
				robot developed by <em>Aldebaran Robotics,</em> , a French
				robotics company headquartered in <strong>Paris</strong>, which
				was acquired by SoftBank Group in 2015 and rebranded as SoftBank
				Robotics. The robot's development began with the launch of
				Project Nao in 2004. On 15 August 2007, Nao replaced Sony's
				robot dog Aibo as the robot used in the RoboCup Standard
				Platform League (SPL), an international robot soccer
				competition.[1] The Nao was used in RoboCup 2008 and 2009, and
				the NaoV3R was chosen as the platform for the SPL at RoboCup
				2010. Several versions of the robot have been released since
				2008. The Nao Academics Edition was developed for universities
				and laboratories for research and education purposes.

			<h2>Software</h2>
			<p>
				The Nao robot is controlled by a specialised
				<strong> Linux-based operating system</strong>, dubbed NAOqi.[4]
				The OS powers the robot's multimedia system, which includes four
				microphones (for voice recognition and sound localization), two
				speakers (for multilingual text-to-speech synthesis) and two HD
				cameras (for computer vision, including facial and shape
				recognition). The robot also comes with a software suite that
				includes a graphical programming tool dubbed Choregraphe,[26] a
				simulation software package and a software developer's kit. Nao
				is furthermore compatible with the Microsoft Robotics Studio,
				Cyberbotics Webots, and the Gostai Studio (URBI).
