    <div> <p> The newer NAO model had cost $9,000 (the same price as the previous generations), but has now increased in price. Through the trade-in program, however, educators receive bit of a discount on the newer model. If you trade in your V4 robot, it costs just $8,700. If you trade in a NAO V5, it costs $7,500</p>
