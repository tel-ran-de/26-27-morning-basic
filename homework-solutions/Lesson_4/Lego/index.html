			<h3>What it does:</h3>
			<div class="description_text">
				<p>
					LEGO Group is a Danish private company engaged in the
					production of the same name series of educational toys,
					which are sets of parts for assembling and modeling a
					variety of objects - building blocks. The second largest
					(after Hasbro) toy manufacturer in the world.

			<h2>Company history</h2>
			<div class="description_text">
				<p>
					The history of the LEGO Group began in the workshop of Ole
					Kirk Christiansen (Danish: Ole Kirk Christiansen[5]) (born
					April 7, 1891), a carpenter from Billund, Denmark, who began
					making wooden toys in 1932[5]. In 1934 his company acquired
					the name LEGO, from the Danish phrase
					<strong>"leg godt,"</strong> which means
					<strong>"play well.</strong>" In 1947 it expanded production
					to plastic toys[5]. In 1949, among other new products, LEGO
					began producing an early version of the now popular
					constructor called<strong>
						"Automatically Connecting Bricks."</strong
					>
					These parts partially took as their basis Kiddicraft's
					self-locking bricks, which had been patented in Britain in
					1939 and released in 1947. After studying a sample provided
					by a British supplier of a molding machine the company
					bought, LEGO modified the Kiddicraft brick design. The
					bricks were originally made of acetyl cellulose and were
					improved traditional wooden composite blocks that were
					joined together with a few round ledges on top and a hollow
					rectangular bottom. The bricks snapped together tightly, but
					at the same time, you didn't have to exert excessive force
					to pull them apart.
				</p>
				<p>
					The motto of the LEGO Group is
					<strong>"Det bedste er ikke for godt.",</strong> which
					translates to
					<strong>"The best isn't good enough yet."</strong> This
					motto was created by Ole Kirk to inspire his employees to
					never skimp on quality, of which he was convinced. This
					motto is used by the company to this day. By 1951 plastic
					toys accounted for half of LEGO's production, though the
					Danish trade magazine Leget√∏js-Tidende ("Toy Times"), which
					visited the LEGO factory in Billund in the early 1950s,
					believed that plastic toys could never replace traditional
					wooden ones. Despite popular opinion, Lego toys became a
					significant exception to the dislike of children's plastic
					toys, in part because of the high standards set by Ole Kirk.
				</p>
				<p>
					By 1954, Christiansen's son Godtfred became the junior
					managing director of Lego. It was his negotiations with
					overseas buyers that led to the ideas for the toy device.
					Godtfred saw in Lego bricks great potential to become a
					device for creative play, but they still had flaws from a
					technical point of view: the docking ability was limited and
					they themselves were not versatile. In 1958, a modern brick
					design was developed, and it took 5 years to find the right
					material - ABS plastic (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene).
					The modern Lego brick was patented on January 28, 1958.
				</p>
				<p>
					The LEGO Duplo product line, introduced in 1969, is a range
					of simple blocks that are twice as wide, longer and taller
					than standard Lego blocks, and designed for small children.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1978, LEGO produced the first minifigures, which have
					since become a staple in most sets. New elements are often
					released along with new sets. There are also LEGO sets
					designed for little girls, such as the Bilville, Clikits
					(older sets), Disney Princess and Friends lines, which
					consist of small interlocking pieces designed to inspire
					creativity and arts and crafts in the same way as regular
					Lego bricks. The Bilville, Clikit, Disney Princess and
					Friends pieces can connect to regular Lego bricks as
					decorative pieces.
				</p>
				<p>
					The LEGO Fabuland series was produced from 1979 to 1989. The
					more advanced LEGO Technic sets began to be produced in
					1977. LEGO Primo is a line of LEGO blocks for young children
					that was produced between 2004 and 2006. In 1995, the LEGO
					Baby series was launched for toddlers.
				</p>
				<p>
					In May 2011, the space shuttle Endeavour took 13 LEGO sets
					to the International Space Station during the STS-134
					mission, where astronauts built models and observed their
					interaction in microgravity as part of the LEGO Briks space
					program. The results of the study were distributed to
					schools as part of an educational project.
				</p>
				<p>
					In May 2013, New York City unveiled the largest model ever
					assembled with LEGO, a 1:1 scale X-Wing fighter built from
					more than 5 million parts. There are other records: a tower
					112 feet high (34.14 meters) and a railroad 4 km long.

				<p>
					<strong>1949</strong> - the appearance of plastic snap dice.
					Their sizes are aligned so that the cubes can be securely
					connected not only at the top, but also at the sides.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1954</strong> - the LEGO brand is officially
					registered in Denmark.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1961</strong> - for the first time cars were also
					assembled from bricks; before that time ordinary scale
					models were attached to the sets and only buildings could be
					built from bricks.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1961</strong> - in North America Samsonite (now a
					famous manufacturer of luggage bags and suitcases) produces
					and sells LEGO sets under license. The cooperation lasts
					until 1988.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1962</strong> - Cubes of minimum height appear,
					equal to 1/3 of the base height.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1963</strong> - for the first time kits come with
					assembly instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1968</strong> - The first amusement park, Legoland,

					Beginning in 1991, with the beginning of the era of computer
					video games, LEGO suffered 11 years of losses, correcting
					this situation only with the release of new robotic sets.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the new popular hobbies is creating cartoons or
					recreating excerpts from existing movies, using LEGO bricks
					for the setting and LEGO figures as characters (LEGO
					animation). Usually such films use the stop-motion animation
					method. Since 2000, this hobby has spread around the world,
					particularly in Germany.

					All <strong>LEGO</strong> building blocks are made to a
					certain standard with a high degree of precision (cubes
					created in 2015 can be docked with cubes produced in 1958),
					which allows them to be connected without much effort. In
					addition, once joined, the parts must be securely fastened
					to each other. To ensure these conditions, the molds for
					stamping the elements of the constructor are made with an
					accuracy of 2 microns[7]. 6 2x4 bricks can be connected in
					915,103,765 ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					Basic concept selection and design and research takes place
					at Lego's headquarters in Billund, where the company employs
					about 120 designers. The company also has small design
					offices in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Japan,
					which are tasked with developing products specifically for
					these markets. The average development period of a new
					product lasts 12 months and consists of three stages. The
					first stage identifies market trends and developments,
					including contacting designers directly with stores; some
					are placed in toy stores shortly before the vacations, while
					others conduct surveys among children. The second phase is
					product design and development based on the results of the
					first phase. Since September 2008, design teams have been
					using 3D modeling software to create CAD drawings from
					initial design sketches. Then, using in-house
					stereolithographic machines, prototypes of the designed
					models are created. These prototypes are provided to the
					project team for comment and are tested by parents and
					children during the review process. The designs can be
					modified according to the results of the focus group
					research. Virtual models of finished Lego products are built
					at the same time as the instruction manual is written.
					Ready-made CAD models are also used more widely, for
					example, for marketing and packaging.
				</p>
				<p>
					The<strong> LEGO</strong> Digital Designer computer program
					is available to consumers to create their own digital
					design, and a similar tool is available for the Google
					Chrome browser. The service to create physical models from
					the LDD program for consumers was closed in 2012.
