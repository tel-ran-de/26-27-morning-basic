      <div class="description_text">
        <p>
          Skype is a proprietary telecommunications application operated by
          Skype Technologies, a division of Microsoft, best known for VoIP-based
          videotelephony, videoconferencing and voice calls. It also has instant
          messaging, file transfer, debit-based calls to landline and mobile
          telephones (over traditional telephone networks), and other features.
          Skype is available on various desktop, mobile, and video game console
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skype was created by Niklas Zennström, Janus Friis, and four Estonian
          developers and first released in August 2003. In September 2005, eBay
          acquired Skype for $2.6 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September 2009,[ Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Canada
          Pension Plan Investment Board bought 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion
          from eBay, valuing the business at $2.92 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion and used it to
          replace their Windows Live Messenger. As of 2011, most of the
          development team and 44% of all the division's employees were in
          Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skype originally featured a hybrid peer-to-peer and client–server
          system. It became entirely powered by Microsoft-operated supernodes in
          May 2012; in 2017, it changed from a peer-to-peer service to a
          centralized Azure-based service.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of March 2020, Skype was used by 100 million people at least once a
          month and by 40 million people each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, Skype lost a large part of its market
          share to Zoom.

      <h2>Company history</h2>
      <div class="description_text">
        <p>
          Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennström, from Sweden, and Janus
          Friis, from Denmark. The Skype software was created by Estonians Ahti
          Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, Jaan Tallinn, and Toivo Annus. Friis and Annus
          are credited with the idea of reducing the cost of voice calls by
          using a P2P protocol like that of Kazaa.
        </p>
        <p>
          An early alpha version was created and tested in spring 2003, and the
          first public beta version was released on 29 August 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
          In June 2005, Skype entered an agreement with the Polish web portal
          Onet.pl for an integrated offering on the Polish market. On 12
          September 2005, eBay Inc. agreed to acquire Luxembourg-based Skype
          Technologies SA for approximately US$2.5 billion in up-front cash and
          eBay stock, plus potential performance-based consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tension between eBay and Skype management teams increased in early
          2008. Continuing shifts in management personnel culminated in the
          departure of Friis and Zennstrom. Josh Silverman became CEO in
          February 2008 and immediately set about concentrating on video calls.
          This shift eliminated previously popular programs like Skype Find and
          Skypecast. Version 4.0 promoted improved video calling with 720p HD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skype 4.1 was launched in 2009. This version introduced the concept of
          screen sharing. Skype 4.1 also used Boingo to offer wireless internet
          access through access points. This was a pay per use service. The
          program would late be dubbed Skype Wi-Fi Access.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 1 September 2009, eBay announced it was selling 65% of Skype to
          Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Canada Pension Plan
          Investment Board for US$1.9 billion, valuing Skype at US$2.75 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion. At this point,
          version 5.3 was being used and this included Facebook integration.
          Group calls were also on offer with this version.

          On 14 July 2011, Skype partnered with Comcast to bring its video chat
          service to Comcast subscribers via HDTV sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2012, Microsoft stated that Skype would become their primary
          messaging service leading to the elimination of Messenger. This
          created a new surge in Skype usage and allowed users to log in with
          their Microsoft account. Skype would start to adopt the overall style
          of Microsoft such as the flat interface surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          While starting out as part of the peer to peer networking movement,
          Skype has become one of the go-to applications for video calling. It
          has been integrated into Microsoft and benefited from the billions
          that the company has put to good use.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 17 June 2013, Skype released a free video messaging service, which
          can be operated on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, iPadOS, Android, and
          BlackBerry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Between 2017 and 2020, Skype collaborated with PayPal to provide a
          money-send feature. It allowed users to transfer funds via the Skype
          mobile app in the middle of a conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019, Skype was announced to be the sixth most downloaded mobile
          app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.
