            <h2>January Musings </h2>
           <div class="shadow1"><p>2022 is so nearly here, and I’m in Spain with my family. With four brothers and all of their families we
                are a noisy bunch and Matthew is just thriving here, surrounded by his cousins and his grandparents. I
                am filled with happiness and joy after spending a wonderful trip away to Somerset and now being with my
                family feels like the cherry on top.
                New Years Eve is also all about family. We head into the square near our house to eat Churros with
                Chocolate in the early evening. Wherever you are as the bells ring for midnight, you eat 12 grapes for
                the last 12 seconds of the year. It’s a tradition I have never missed. I am so excited that this year
                will be Matthew's very first Kings Day Celebration. This is also a tradition near to my heart and it's
                so special to pass this through to Matthew.

            <h2>Festive Spanish Traditions</h2>
            <div class="shadow1"><p>We are amidst celebrating the wonderful festive season! Although the British traditions of Father
                Christmas and writing lists to Santa are still so magical, I wanted to take the time to share the
                typical Spanish traditions that take place during December and January.

                Having been born and raised in Spain, I have always known Christmas to be quite a different event as to
                how the British and Americans celebrate it. Still packed with family and joy, but by welcoming a
                different novelty of festivities that last right up until 6th January!

                In Spain, the children wait patiently until the 6th of January for the arrival of the Three Wise Men
                rather than Father Christmas on the 24th of December. Known as Reyes Magos day in Spain, the 6th January
                is always a bank holiday. It is a celebration of the adoration of the baby Jesus by the Three Kings;
                Melchor, Gaspar and Balthazar. Aiming to arrive by the 24th December to present baby Jesus with symbolic
                gifts, the Three Kings got lost along their way. After a few days, they were guided by the star which
                finally led them to the stable and little Jesus.
