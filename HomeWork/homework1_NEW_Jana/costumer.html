            <p>Buying baby, toddler and kids clothes can be a joy, especially if you set out with a clear idea of the
                sizing you
                need. Wriggly babies, toddler tantrums and bored children are all hurdles so get prepared with our kids
                clothing
                size chart! We have filtered by age group (including baby and junior) and have included both centimetres
                (cm)
                and inches (“). Whether it’s dress sizes or shirts you’re after, check the chart first.

                At Pepa & Co, we cater for newborns up to 10 years and have therefore focused this page on these
                specific ages
                only. Here you will find your handy children’s clothing size chart with all the dimensions in height,
                weight,
                and waist as well as commonly asked questions we receive regarding sizing.

                *Please note that the below size chart is average sizing of the garments. For sizing of specific
                garments please
                read individual product descriptions for further details or contact our customer service team at
                hola@pepaandcompany.com.

            <p> <strong>Sizing for Newborns </strong>

                Newborn sizes are from 0-3 months. That is a height of up to approximately 56cm. Babies will grow a
                tremendous amount within the first year, and first few months in particular. In fact, you will not grow
                any faster throughout your life than in that first year.

                At Pepa & Co, newborn sizing is expected to fit across the first three months and possibly beyond this
                too depending on the child. You will need lots of essentials such as babygrows, bibs, towels and hats;
                the important element in common is to keep the baby snug and warm. Think sleeping items for 24/7 and
                this is what your newborn needs. The key with newborns is keeping warm so the all-in-ones (onesies)
                often have feet already with them. We have matching sets to not only make it easy for you, but to make
                it easy for your friends to get you the perfect gift!

                We have many pima cotton newborn items that are perfect for newborns. This type of cotton is
                hypoallergenic and resistant to piling, making it not only perfect for babies and newborns, but for
                premature babies too.

                You may find newborn clothing is too small if you have a tiny or premature baby. All newborn clothing
                should be on the bigger side so you get the most use out of it but there are specific premature clothing
                ranges to help you along the way.

                It is worth stocking up on garments before the baby arrives but do keep the receipts and tags – newborns
                and babies can vary massively and you don’t want to fork out for different sizes once the baby is born.

            <p> <strong>Sizing for Babies </strong>

                Babies start to develop their own personalities and with this you can begin dressing your little ones in
                actual clothes! The transition between babygrows and baby clothes is around the 3-6 months (between
                58-64cm). From here, you can have bodysuits and rompers which are perfect for babies starting to fidget
                and move but also offer that comfort they may still need.

                Essentials will still be the sleepsuits and all-in-ones, especially around the house but for everyday
                wear, bodysuits are a great choice. Rather than heading straight for a top, bodysuits are an all-in-one
                without the legs that will not ride up and is therefore completely comfortable for the little one.

                Now is the time that you can consider shoes as well. Pram shoes are ideal for that time between crawling
                and walking then you can go to a rubber sole for more confident walkers. We have more about our shoe
                sizing on this page.

            </P> <strong>Sizing for Toddlers</strong>

                Toddlers are generally between 18 months to 3 years (80cm-100cm) although this age tends to vary
                depending on your perception and how quickly the child is growing.

                Toddler is a great age to dress your child – they have really developed their own quirks and start to
                have opinions on their dress sense, but ultimately, you’re still in charge! Due to obvious reasons,
                clothes must be robust; they’re constantly figuring out the world and the clothes face the full-front of
                this exploration! Expect stains galore…
